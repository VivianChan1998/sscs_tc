# Showcase website built for artists

<div>Aimed to let illustrators, artists, and creators build up their own page to show their work, which the page itself is an artwork.</div>

A delicate website that can be arranged by users themselves, to showcase their artwork, and even use it as an <b>illustration portfolio</b>.

### Why
As an illustrator myself, I show my artworks on Instagram. But when I want to give an overview of my art style, favor in color, I will like to have a page that is easy to change theme and update. 
Moreover, I want to be in the <b>circle of illustrators</b>.
I would like to browse through other people's work, with the style they established, as the first impression when entering the page. 

### How
- Javascript 
    - React.js
    - Express.js
- HTML5
- CSS3

### And...
- This was my first Web project, written two months after I began learning Web programming.
- Did some simple user research on my art account on Instagram before starting to design the page.
- Written all code by myself (also intentionally practiced all CSS without using libraries), including all the grid arrangements, animation, layout, and so on.

### Impacts and Future works
- It started as a school project but then my friends and fans of my art Instagram account started to show interest and gave a lot of feedbacks.
- Other creators/artists said it is really an exciting idea to establish a platform like this. Especially because there are no such kind of showcasing website prevelant between Asian Illustrators.
- I am now rewriting it in my free time as my own side-project.
