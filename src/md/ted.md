# TEDxNationalTaiwanUniversity Exhibition 2019
<div>
As college students, being at a loss is inevitable. This exhibition wants to deliever a simple message: you are not the only one who may feel lost sometimes, you <b>will</b> eventually find the way out.

I designed the visual identity of TEDxNationalTaiwanUniversity's annual exhibition. This exhibition is held in the campus of National Taiwan University.
The main purpose of this exhibition, is to let the students who came, realize that other students, <b>no matter what age or background, can be at a loss, be perplexed, in some period of life.</b>
We couldn't provide answers, but from this exhibiton, we can show them that people who seems to be successful now all came through somehow the same kind of perplexity we may have had.

##### colors
Deep blue represents a peaceful ocean, quiet on the surface, but filled with vortexs and swirls below, just like how perplexity seems to be. However, it isn't something tragedy nor serious. Thus the remaining colors are bright and gentle.
