### Why
Playing games with friends is always a nice thing to enjoy! Thus we decided to make an online game by ourselves. We want the rules to be simple, the manipulation to be simple, and the most important is, we want to <b>take the least time to get the most immersed excitement.</b>

### How
- Javascript
    - React.js
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Adobe Illustrator
    - All chacters, ink pattern, game logo designed by myself!
